1) Given a list of strings, write a method that returns a list of all strings that start with the letter ‘a’ (lower case) and have exactly 3 letters. TIP: Use Java 8 Lambdas and Streams API’s.
2) Write a Java Program to remove all white spaces from a string without using replace().
3) Write a Java Program to swap two numbers without using the third variable.
